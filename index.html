  <h3 >My jumbling Intrests</h3>
  <p >I initially joined ece bcoz im very much intrested in physics.I wanted to explore in the field of semiconductors.<br/>
At the same time i wanted to learn autocad(a random intrest -_-)<br/>
  Along with these too I love to code and always wanted to design a game.<br/>
so my brain is filled with lot of goals.Hope i would cmplt all of them by the end of my 4th yr.</p></div>

  <h3 >Nitt life</h3>
  <p >To be frank I spent my total first year in sleeping.I think this is the first time aftr joining nitt  where im utilising my time and brain properly.<br/>
And i hate the 1st yr faculty who r not having min knowledge.<br/>
I realised that the most intresting part and secret of development of nitt is "BY THE STUDENTS","FOR THE STUDENTS"</p>
